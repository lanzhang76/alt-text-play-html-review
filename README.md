# What we saw

A travel log that documents a day's trip across the image-filled web. The log's contents were generated using a custom Chrome extension that looks for alt text - short descriptions that accompany many of the web's images. While alt text typically lives "behind the scenes", the log flips the concept inside-out: it brings the text to the surface, and reveals alt images only on inspection. This is the first part of our ongoing extension-based experiment, playing with forms and materials of the web.

# Does it require internet to work?

Yes.

## What we used to write "What we saw"

We made a chrome extension tool for our play with forms and materials of the web - ["What I saw"](https://github.com/lanzhang76/alt-text-play-extension). At the extension's current stage, it can extract alt text of images on the web page you are browsing, the raw image javascript object containing the alt text and source data, and a bonus fun feature - a haiku generator.
